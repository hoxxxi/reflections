1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories allow users to contribute to a project from several different machines as well as to collaborate with other developers.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might work on a new version that is not ready to be shared with the rest of the world.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork copies a repository on GitHub to a new repository on your account (keeping history of previous commits).
Clone copies an online repository to your local machine or copies a local repository to another location.
Branches extend current commits to give a view of how the code should progress.
