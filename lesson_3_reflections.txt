1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories allow users to contribute to a project from several different machines as well as to collaborate with other developers.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might work on a new version that is not ready to be shared with the rest of the world.
